# alisonlee-landing-page
The code behind my personal landing page. All created by me. 

The purpose of my landing page is to establish my personal professional brand online.

MVP version is a quick one-page professional elevator pitch. It will advertise my freelance skills and what type of work I like doing. 

Future ideas may lead to new pages and menu...

# contents
Links: LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium, Instagram
Blurb: Steak from about.me 

# technical details
Add stuff here when I set up the domain name

# future page ideas
Host my Medium writing on the site instead?
Host examples of my past work and community initiatives
Knitting, cooking, Muay Thai and cycling could get their own page.
